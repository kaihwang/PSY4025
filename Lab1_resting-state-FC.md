# Hands on Lab session #1, resting-state functional connectivity

For this hands on lab practice, we will be using data from sub-001 that you downloaded and processed from the previous block. \
They should be located at `$HOME/fmrilab/data/`   \
You should also have the "skull-striped T1 image" saved under `$HOME/fmrilab/data/bids/sub-001/anat/` \
If not, please follow the instructions and redo those steps: https://github.com/mwvoss/MRI-lab-classes/blob/master/PSY4025-2020-FA2020/practical_download-and-prepare-class-data.md


## What you will learn from this lab practice
- How to replicate the famous Biswal finding \
![Biswal](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Felicity_Callard/publication/235626041/figure/fig2/AS:667107696078858@1536062277477/Bharat-Biswal-and-colleagues-1995-first-demonstrated-that-regions-involved-in-a-motor.png)
- Understand how to preprocess fMRI data for resting-state functional connectivity analysis
- Understand how to extract and input a "seed" timeseries to search for brain regions that show resting-state connectivity with this "seed"
